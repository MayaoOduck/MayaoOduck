i really dont know how to use github or any other learning platform basICALLY any writing platform most of them charge money that not wrong its me who dosent wanna invest but i wish i could read them for free insted of never oening those. is this gonna be in my bio but who gonna teach me there are zero ollaboration. ya so i was teling one good thing about these platforms are you can write whatever you want without people judging you i mean they would or they might but you people are not aquaned only na.
